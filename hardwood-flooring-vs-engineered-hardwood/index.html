<p>Engineered wood floors come ready to be installed so staining on-site isnt necessary. And because the layers are perpendicular to each other there is usually less expansion and contraction so it allows for a tighter fit especially during the winter when its more dry. Unlike engineered floors which are floated over a sublayer and require no nailing or glue hardwood floors are attached to a subfloor usually plywood or furring strips over a vapor barrier. You can lightly sand boards a few times with some brands and they are much easier to install overall.
