<p>I used a 15g pneumatic finish nailer on the starting row but I had to return it to the rental place. Make a hole through the face of the flooring plank about 3 inches from the end of the plank and about 14 inch in from the edge of the plank that will lie closest to the wall. I have a beginners question as to the correct type of nail to use when installing the last few rows of 34 prefinished hardwood close to the wall. All of the plank face-nails can be filled with wood putty to match the flooring. Pin Auf Blame Pinterest.</p>

For best results you should use a flooring nailer that will give sufficient grip to your panels. The last couple of rows should be glued and face nailed.
