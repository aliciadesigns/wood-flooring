<p>The conceptual approach places the quantum of development intelligently on the site. DESIGN CONCEPT The beginning of wisdom for a software engineer is to recognize the difference between getting a program to work and getting it right. The architectural design of a software system specifies the link between the primary structural aspects of the system under consideration. Design which is a medium-level pattern type that is. Designing a model is an important phase and is a multi-process that represent the data structure program structure interface characteristic and procedural details.</p>
