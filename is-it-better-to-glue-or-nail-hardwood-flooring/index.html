Engineered hardwood floors can be glued or nailed into position but they also have the option of being floated over an underlay. Gluing would help mitigate this. If youve chosen a professional to fit your floor they will help you make the right decision.

When you get into only nailing wide planks that are 4 or wider you can get some movement at the center and back side of the boards which can create a noisy floor and make it harder to sand an unfinished floor. The nail down method means that the flooring planks are nailed to your wood subfloor. The glue-down method is commonly used in slab construction because it allows the flooring to be attached directly to a concrete slab.
