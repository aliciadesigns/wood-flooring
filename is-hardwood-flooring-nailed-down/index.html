<p>Nailed floors too offer a solid and engineered appearance that does not get affected due to temperature changes. Engineered hardwood floors can be glued or nailed into position but they also have the option of being floated over an underlay. If you choose to fix your hardwood floor into position you then have the choice of either gluing your floor to the subfloor using flexible flooring. Typically the flooring is blind nailed through the tongue a portion of the wood plank that protrudes from the board and fits into the groove of the adjacent board.
