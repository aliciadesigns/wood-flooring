<p>CAD centralizes product design into an automated 3D environment. CAD or computer-aided design and drafting CADD is technology for design and technical documentation which replaces manual drafting with an automated process. Computer-aided manufacturing CAM uses geometrical design data to control automated machinery. CAD programs eliminate the tedious manual drafting process replacing it with an automated process in which designers can change their drawings or designs and immediately view or print the modified results.</p>

<p>Benefits of using CAD design software include more precise drawing ease for the designer to share plans with clients and third parties such as general contractors and engineers and secure archiving of past projects. Computer-aided design CAD is the use of computer technology by architects engineers and others for design and drawing. CAD allows for simple and accurate automation andor process modeling known as Mechanical Design Automation. Computer-aided Design CAD software enables the design of patient-specific cranial implants but it often requires of a lot of manual user-interactions. Computer aided design is an activity where design engineers draughtsmen and drawing assistants use specialized interactive computer systems as their assisting instruments in order to formulate and solve technical design problems and to communicate the resulting problem solutions.</p>
