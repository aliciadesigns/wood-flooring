<p><strong>Is It Better To Use Staples Or Nails For Hardwood Flooring</strong>, You can use either staples or nails for installing or replacing hardwood floors. The latter are less suitable for hardwoods and would not be used outside so the staple is best here while the staple would not be suitable for milled pieces fine detail work or in places where a visible nail would be detrimental to the piece being created. Insuring you have a suitable subfloor is the most important ingredient for any successful installation when laying solid 34 hardwoods. Ive done many hardwood floors both on my own and working with multiple different companies and I have always only ever seen staples used.</p>

<p>Nailing or stapling down wood floor is the most common and preferred install method for wood floor professionals if a wood subfloor in form of plywood or OSB exists in the house. Each has its advantages but the success of either method will depend on the size and length of the nails or staples that are used. It is not necessary to nail or staple this type of flooring down because the perimeter is held into place by moulding such as shoe moulding or quarter round. Using a pneumatic tool staples are used to secure hardwood flooring to a plywood subfloor.</p>

<p>Flooring straps can also be used to hold the boards into place. There is no need to glue the planks together as they are fully bonded to the subfloor. The reason for the smooth area at the top of the shank is to allow for the hardwood floor to expand and contract with seasonal temperature and humidity changes. However flooring staples are more likely to back out as wood expands and contracts loosening the hold and increasing the risk of squeaks.

<p>I would take staples over regular nails hands-down for staying power but seeing the design of these cleats that looks very impressive. The latter are less suitable for hardwoods and would not be used outside so the staple is best here while the staple would not be suitable for milled pieces fine detail work or in places where a visible nail would be detrimental to the piece being created.
