<p>Some installers will say it is safe to install widths up to 3 inches but smaller widths will have less overall movement in response to the radiant heating. Tile and hardwood flooring work best when installed over a radiant heating system since these types of flooring feel cold in winter. You may need to lay down a vapor barrier or thin underlayment underneath the flooring to help allow it to float evenly over the radiant heat flooring. With the right experience moisture testing understanding of the radiant heat system and knowledge about the wood flooring being used contractors can make wood flooring over radiant heat workeven work extremely well. This means homeowners can now enjoy the natural beauty of hickory oak cherry walnut maple ash and any other fine hardwood plus the efficiency and luxurious comfort provided by radiant heating.</p>
