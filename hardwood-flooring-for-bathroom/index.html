<p><strong>Hardwood Flooring For Bathroom</strong>, This includes both softwoods like fir and pine and hardwoods like maple. Engineered hardwood flooring is dimensionally stable and therefore does not fluctuate too much in response to humidity so its generally best to go with engineered floors instead of solid wood.
