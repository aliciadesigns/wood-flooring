<p><strong>Wooden Floors For Grey Kitchens</strong>, In 2021 and I believe for at least the next decade you will see a surge in low-maintenance flooring like waterproof vinyl. Nuanced grey tones can be brought in through concrete work surfaces or a beautiful lime plaster finish on the walls like the one that interior designer Mark Lewis has created in a converted gothic church. And while you can make a strong case for all of them. While natural hardwood floors arent generally recommended for the kitchen engineered hardwood flooring can be installed in high-moisture areas thanks to its multiple-ply construction and heavy-duty protective coat.</p>
