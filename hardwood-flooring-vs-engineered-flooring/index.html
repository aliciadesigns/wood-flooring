<p>Floating floors are a more economical and affordable engineered hardwood flooring option. Engineered hardwood is more forgiving with moisture as its more stable. Different wood types used in the surface layer such as hickory are more durable compared to woods such as maple or California redwood. Engineered hardwood is better for more intricate designs or patterns while solid hardwood is best for a natural wood floor appearance. Because engineered hardwood floors only contain a thin layer of true hardwood they can typically be refinished just once or twice in their lifetime.</p>
