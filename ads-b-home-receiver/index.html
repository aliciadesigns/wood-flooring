Modern planes use something called an ADS-B Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Mode-S transponder which periodically broadcasts location and altitude information to air traffic controllers. ADS-B is used by aircraft to transmit their position to the ground. This information isnt encrypted and anyone can build themselves a receiver to take those transmissions and draw. Since ADS-B is a digital form of modulation that uses 2MHZ bandwidth being a little off in either direction wont affect your signal.</p>
