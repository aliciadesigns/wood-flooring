<p>A finish nailer not a brad nailer would normally only be used for face nailing straight down from the top at the last row or at the beginning nailed through the tongue where you cant use the flooring nailer due to wall interferance. I install subfloors with 1 12 8 decking screws in my Quik Drive gun and use 1 14 8 deckig. Some installers prefer to use a lightweight flooring nailer such as the Powernail 50F which drives 18-gauge cleat nails. What kind of pneumatic nailer and nailsstaples do I use.
