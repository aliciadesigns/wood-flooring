<p>This type of flooring is created by bonding a thin veneer of hardwood to a base of plywood or MDF. There are also notable pros and cons associated with this particular type of flooring. Hardwood flooring can be bought prefinished or it can be finished on-site as part of the installation. However prefinished hardwood flooring is sometimes milled so that the planks have slightly beveled edges and this design can be problematic in kitchens.

Competitively priced Wood flooring is more affordable than tile and polished concrete and competitive with LVT when the cost of materials and installation is considered. Our prefinished hardwood selection will soon be the largest and most diverse collection of prefinished hardwood flooring on the web. Other more open grained and lighter colored hardwoods in the likes of Maple and Birch should be avoided unless you live in a careful household.
