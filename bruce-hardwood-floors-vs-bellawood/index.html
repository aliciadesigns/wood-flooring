<p>Its considered more sustainable in some cases but doesnt hold up to the durability and feel of solid hardwood flooring. I have used Bona cleaner for years and I honestly wasnt very happy with it the reason I kept using it was because my husband liked it because of the way it smells. I am looking at 34 solid oak maybe ash too. Wood species refers to the type of hardwood used to make either solid or engineered hardwood flooring.

<p>There are a range of different widths available and prices range from 199 per square foot to 775 per square foot depending on wood species. The worst part was the amount of waste due to cracked pieces and the varying widths which leads to irregular spaces.
