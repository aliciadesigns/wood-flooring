<p><strong>Are Engineered Floor Joists Better</strong>, Some installers and end-users are not aware of those limitations and install or use them anyway. I-Joists have what is called span charts that can be utilized by the carpenters to allow for a variety of job site modifications. Engineered joists are constructed of wood chips and use toxic free resins as the binding agents so they are very environmentally friendly. These are also very good over longer spans and since they have a low moisture content after production they shrink very little and result in few loose fasteners and subsequent floor squeaking.</p>

<p>Floor trusses cannot be modified on site due to a field discrepancy without an engineers seal. It performs even better when exposed to excessive amounts of water usually requiring only drying to its original moisture content. I-joists can be a great product for a new home project. Engineered wood joists and trusses are easier to specify are more stable than dimensional lumber and are easier to install.

<p>That being said I would not use ANYTHING but engineered floor joists even on very small additions. Nowadays however engineered wood floor systems are undergoing rapid market growth due to. However if a deeper joist is used on a bigger span the joist price will reduce against a shallow depth as the depth allows the joist to work with smaller timbers and less metal webs. The advantage of I-joists is they are less likely to bow crown twist cup check or split as would a dimensional piece of lumber.
