<p>The only case in which expansion gaps are not required for the engineered wood floor when working over large areas is a full glue-down fitting method. Expansion gaps are spaces left around the perimeter of rooms against fixed objects such as columns thresholds hearths baseboard and other stationary items built or secured into the framing structure of the home. This puzzles me - Im installing the classic 34 tongue and groove hardwood flooring and it gets nailed down through the groove with flooring nails every 12-18. The expansion gap provides your laminate floor the room to cope with this natural expansion and contraction caused primarily by changing temperatures. Pin On Woodworking Projects.</p>

<p>The transition pictured is a solid piece of wood 37 14 x 4 14 x 34. Expert installers say that the larger the space the larger the expansion gap should be as the floor needs more. The larger the room the larger the gap must be. If you expose wood to a higher RH given enough time its MC will increase and the flooring will swell. Pin On Decor.</p>
