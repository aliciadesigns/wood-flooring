<p>Adaptive reuse also utilizes as many interior materials and components as possible while reimagining it as a modern flexible building that fits todays and tomorrows needs. Adaptive reuse architecture and design ArchDaily. Renovations and adaptive reuse have the additional benefit of being more environmentally friendly as these projects generally do not require replacing carbon-heavy concrete and steel structural systems. For example converting an old church into a restaurant an old train station into an office space or an old windmill into a home.</p>
