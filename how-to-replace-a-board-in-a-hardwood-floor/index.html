<p>One strategy is to work backwards from the end of the installation toward the place where you need to replace the boards. Then get your new floor board which should be retrofitted then apply some adhesive and fit the board back into the spot where the old board was. Measure and cut your replacement board to length. Basically youll slip the tongue of your new board into the groove of the old board and it will squeeze into place.
