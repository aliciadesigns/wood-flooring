<p>These days engineered hardwood flooring is more and more popular. The weathered faces are pre-sanded and graded resulting in the most unique floor available on the market today. We recently re-oiled a beautiful re-claimed 12 inch wide sawed pine plank floor in Conway. Sawyer Masons Vintage Collection features several new colors finished with Bona Naturale - a unique floor finish that preserves the true nature of the wood while giving your floor a durable protection.

<p>This home was built about 12 years ago and has one of the most unique floors that weve seen. It is sawn using the Old World European method and incorporates all aspects of the logs character. From rustic hardwood flooring to new wide plank floors and engineered floors every Carlisle floor is a masterpiece that is handcrafted to reflect the owners sense of style and sophistication. Planks over 7 inches must be top nailed with colonial rosehead nails or fastened with screws and plugs. Pin Von Jo Cowley Auf Living Room Haus Bodenbelag Rustikale Holzboden Haus Boden.</p>
