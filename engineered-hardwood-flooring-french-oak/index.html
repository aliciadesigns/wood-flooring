<p>French Forest Floors was established in 1987 following the great gales of that year when both the south of England and northern France lost thousands of trees most of these being oak. This gives French Oak more beautiful patina and a classic time-worn look. For our French Oak hardwood flooring we only select Oak from France because it has higher tannin than any other Oak around the globe. French Oak is grown in forests that have been a model for sustainable hardwood management for the last 300 years.
